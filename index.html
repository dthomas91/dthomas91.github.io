    <a id="about_section"><h1>About</h1></a>
    <p>I am a full stack web developer that recently graduated from LEARN Academy. I am excited about transitioning into a new career in the tech industry. After spending several year in the criminal justice field, I was ready to make a change that would benefit my family the most and I believe that technology is the the best direction for that change.</p>
    <br>
    <p>During the coding bootcamp I learned several coding languages such as JavaScript, Ruby, Rails, Ruby on Rails, HTML, and CSS. I used these skills to work both individually and as part of a team to design and create various apps as part of the learning process. Paired programming is method we used extensively while in the bootcamp, while doing so I learn valuable skills such as being a team member in a virtual setting, and helping each other become more efficient during the coding process.</p>
    <br>
    <p>I am currently looking to become a junior developer and member of a coding team. I’d love to set up a time to speak with you to see if to see if I am a good fit to fill any of the needs your company may have for a full stack developer.</p>
